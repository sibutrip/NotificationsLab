# NotificationsLab

## Instructions
- Clone the repo: 
  - https://github.com/sibutrip/NotificationsLab
- Follow the documentation to implement local notifications:    
  - https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/scheduling_a_notification_locally_from_your_app 
- Complete the 3 ViewModel functions that create notifications:
  - createCalendarNotification
  - createTimerNotification
  - createLocationNotification
- Complete the 1 ViewModel function that cancels pending notifications
  - cancelNotification
- BONUS: 
  - Handle the try! expression in AddNotificationView in a safer way. (Hint: What information does the user need to be presented with when an action fails? How do we present that information?)
